# Learn Python

Learn Python from the basics to advanced features through hands-on examples and practical exercises.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to helping learners master Python. It provides a structured path from beginner topics to more advanced programming concepts. Whether you are new to Python or looking to expand your skills, you'll find a range of resources and examples to support your learning journey.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories to cater to different language preferences:

- **en/**: Contains tutorials, Jupyter notebooks, and examples in English.
- **zh/**: Contains equivalent materials in Chinese for native speakers or those preferring Chinese resources.

Additional files include:
- **.DS_Store**: (macOS system file, can be ignored)
- **google93e5ad52f9ce370b.html**: A file for site verification purposes (if needed).

## Getting Started

To get started with the Python materials:
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StudySage/learn_python.git
   cd learn_python
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**  
   Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Launch Jupyter Notebook with:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then, open any notebook file (.ipynb) to begin learning.

   **Better Options:**  
   You can also open the notebook files in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for playing with the codes.

   Copy and open the urls in Google Colab:
   - [chapter_1_python_basic.ipynb](https://github.com/StudySage/learn_python/blob/main/en/chapter_1_python_basic.ipynb)
   - [chapter_2_functions_and_modules.ipynb](https://github.com/StudySage/learn_python/blob/main/en/chapter_2_functions_and_modules.ipynb)

## Learning Path

The content is designed to gradually build your Python skills:
- **Introduction and Basics:** Learn fundamental Python syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Intermediate Topics:** Explore functions, modules, file I/O, and error handling.
- **Advanced Features:** Dive into object-oriented programming, advanced libraries, and best practices.

Each section is accompanied by example code and exercises to reinforce your understanding.
